### Layout:

| Layout | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `layout=double:chat` | Two columns; right column has a chat box. This is the default |
| `layout=single:chat` | One column with a chat box |
| `layout=double:nochat` | Two columns without a chat box |
| `layout=single:nochat` | One column without a chat box |
| `layout=double:slim` | Two columns without headers, settings, or a chat box |
| `layout=single:slim` | One column without header, settings, or a chat box |
| `layout=double` | Exactly `layout=double:chat` |
| `layout=single` | Exactly `layout=single:chat` |
| `layout=tesla` | Special layout for use on embedded browsers, such as in a Tesla. This is similar to `layout=single:slim` but changes numerous other behaviors |

For a `single` column, the module is `module1`. For `double` columns, the left module is `module1` and the right module is `module2`.

### Module configuration:

`module1=<name>,<flags>,<kw-include>,<user-include>,<user-exclude>,<start-exclude>,<channel-exclude>`

`module2=<name>,<flags>,<kw-include>,<user-include>,<user-exclude>,<start-exclude>,<channel-exclude>`

If `layout` is `single`, `module1` is shown. Otherwise, `module1` is the left module and `module2` the right.

`name`: Module's name

`flags`: a sequence of 1s (shown) or 0s (filtered) for `Pleb`, `Sub`, `VIP`, `Mod`, `Events`, `Bits`, and `/me`.

`kw-include`: Display the message if it contains the value given, overriding excludes

`user-include`: Always show messages from this user, overriding

`user-exclude`: Don't show messages from this user

`start-exclude`: Don't show messages starting with the value given

`channel-exclude`: Exclude messages from this channel (for `layout=double` usage)

Default: `module1=Chat,1111111,,,,,&module2=Chat,1111111,,,,,`

### Cheer Effects:

The following cheer effects are available and cost one bit each.

| Effect Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `marquee` | Message scrolls from right to left across the chat window |
| `bold` | Message is bold |
| `italic` | Message is italicised |
| `underline` | Message is underlined |
| `upsidedown` | Message is upside-down (may not work with some other effects) |
| `inverted` | Message uses inverted colors (may not work with some other effects) |
| `strikethrough` | Message has a strike-through |
| `subscript` | Message is formatted as a subscript |
| `superscript` | Message is formatted as a superscript |
| `big` | Message is bigger than normal |
| `small` | Message is smaller than normal |
| `rainbow` | Message is rainbow (red -> yellow -> green -> cyan -> blue -> purple -> red) |
| `disco` | Message cycles through the rainbow colors in order |
| color | Message will use the color specified, by name (won't work with rainbow). Almost every color you can think of should work (see `config.js` `ColorNames`) |

To use them, add them to the message after the cheer:

  `cheer3 bold marquee rainbow Hello streamer`: This message is big, rainbow, and scrolling across the screen`

  `cheer1 rainbow marquee Hello`: This message isn't scrolling because effects cost one bit each`

  `marquee cheer1 Hey there`: This message has no extra formatting; the effect must be immediately after the cheer.

  `cheer1 big blue bold Greetings`: The message is big, bold, and blue.

### Examples:

Connect to `#dwangoAC` with default configuration:

  `?channels=dwangoAC`

Connect to `#pangaeapanga` with no chat:

  `?channels=pangaeapanga&layout=double:nochat`

Connect to `#dwangoAC` in slim mode, filtering `TAS9000` and messages starting with `!`:

  `?channels=dwangoac&module1=Chat,1111111,,,TAS9000,!,&layout=single:slim`

Connect to `#dwangoAC` and `#pangaeapanga`, showing `#dwangoAC` chat in the left column and `#pangaeapanga` in the right column. Filter out `Stay_Hydrated_Bot`, `Nightbot`, and `TAS9000`.

  `?channels=%23dwangoac%2C%23pangaeapanga&module1=dwangoAC's%2520Chat%2C1111111%2C%2C%2CTAS9000%252CNightbot%252CStay_Hydrated_Bot%2C!%2C%252523dwangoAC&module2=pangaeapanga's%2520Chat%2C1111111%2C%2C%2CTAS9000%252CNightbot%252CStay_Hydrated_Bot%2C!%2C&layout=double%3Anochat`

### Hotkeys

The following hotkeys are available:

| Key Name | Action |
| -------- | ------ |
| `ScrollLock` | Toggles automatic scrolling when new messages are received |
| `Escape` | Closes all visible settings windows |
| `F1` | Open the configuration help window |

## Testing

Please test the filtered chat in your own browser. Load it up and ensure you can change settings and that things work as you'd expect.

If you have errors loading that, try the following link:

## Development

For getting started, you will need both this and `twitch-api`:
```bash
mkdir tfc && cd tfc # optional
checkout https://github.com/Kaedenn/twitch-filtered-chat
checkout https://github.com/Kaedenn/twitch-api
cd twitch-filtered-chat
```
and have fun!

### Vim Support

These files use vim section labels to assist code folding. You may use the following if `foldmethod=section` doesn't work for you.

```vim
function! <SID>FoldAllSections(...)
  let oldpos = getpos(".")
  call setpos(".", [bufnr("%"), 0, 0, 0])
  let s = search("{{{[0-9]", "W")
  while s != 0
    let ls = line(".")
    let sn = getline(".")[match(getline("."), "{{{[0-9]") + 3][0]
    let le = search(sn . "}}}", "nW")
    execute(":" . ls . "," . le . "fold")
    execute(":" . ls . "," . le . "foldopen")
    let s = search("{{{[0-9]", "W")
  endwhile
  execute(":normal zM")
  call setpos(".", oldpos)
endfunction

map <leader>F :call <SID>FoldAllSections()^M
```

Note that `^M` refers to a literal `^M` character: `^V^M` on Linux. This can be omitted; you will instead need to press Enter after typing `<leader>F`.
